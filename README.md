## 6-DOF Robotic Arm in ROS 2

## Project Overview:
Over the project we built and simulated a 6-Degree-of-Freedom (6-DOF) robotic manipulator in a virtual industrial environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS2). The goal was to take a robotic arm from digital modeling all the way to intelligent motion control — an end-to-end robotic development pipeline.

## Milestone 1: Robot Modeling with URDF in ROS
We started by designing a realistic manipulator using:
URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) to define the robot’s joints, links, and mechanical structure.
Gazebo to simulate the robot’s physical behavior in a 3D environment with realistic dynamics.
Attention to physical accuracy and structure was key to preparing the model for planning and control.

## Milestone 2: Motion Planning & Control with MoveIt 
Once our model was complete, we moved on to building the robot’s "intelligence":
Used MoveIt to create safe, smooth trajectories for the manipulator to reach given goals.
Visualized the planning and execution process in RVIZ and Gazebo.
